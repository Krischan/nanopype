# Methylation

Nanopore sequencing enables the simultaneous readout of sequence and base modification status on single molecule level. Nanopype currently integrates nanopolish and flappie to detect 5mC DNA methylation. To obtain the methylation readout of a single Flow-Cell using nanopolish run:  

    snakemake --snakefile /path/to/nanopype/Snakefile methylation/nanopolish.5x.hg38.bedGraph

or

    snakemake --snakefile /path/to/nanopype/Snakefile methylation/nanopolish.5x.hg38.bw

If not already present, this will trigger basecalling and alignment of the raw data. Similar to the basecalling and alignment modules a *runnames.txt* in the working directory is required. Furthermore only CpGs with at least 5x coverage are reported. The *5x* in the commands file name is an arbitrary tag, the minimum coverage is set in the config.yaml:

:   * methylation_min_coverage: 1

## Tools

The output of nanopore methylation calling tools on a lower level is not consistent. Here we provide the description of the intermediate results, enabling more advanced analysis.

### Nanopolish

The bed-like intermediate output file contains per read and CpG methylation log-likelihood ratios as well as the raw log-p values from the nanopolish HMM.

    chr6	31164635	31164635	2975d04a-9890-43cd-880b-28a1d72b0f19	2.31	-146.60	-148.91

A log-likelihood ratio greater 2.5 is considered a methylated CpG, a ratio less than -2.5 is called unmethylated. To get genome wide mean methylation levels in bedGraph or BigWig format you can use:

To directly get the single read methylation levels you can run:

    snakemake --snakefile /path/to/nanopype/Snakefile methylation/nanopolish/20180101_FAH12345_FLO-MIN106_SQK-LSK108_WA01.hg38.tsv.gz

Nanopolish specific configuration parameters are:

:   * methylation_nanopolish_logp_threshold: 2.5
    * methylation_nanopolish_basecaller: albacore
    * methylation_nanopolish_aligner: minimap2
    * methylation_min_coverage: 1

### Flappie

Flappie is a new ONT neural network basecaller with a default output alphabet of *ACGT*. Using a different model, a methylation status prediction in CpG contexts is possible. A methylated Cytosine is then encoded as *Z*.
