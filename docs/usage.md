# Usage

The basic concept of snakemake and thus also nanopype is to request an output file which can be generated from one or more input files. Snakemake will recursively build a graph and determine required intermediate or temporary data to be processed. In general you can run snakemake from within your processing directory with

    snakemake --snakefile /path/to/nanopype/Snakefile [OPTIONS...] [FILE]

or from the installation path with specifying the working directory:

    snakemake --directory /path/to/processing [OPTIONS...] [FILE]

Nanopype expects a **config.yaml** in the root of the processing directory. A template with default values is found in the nanopype repository. You can either edit the parameters within the file or override them from the command line:

    snakemake --config threads_basecalling=16 [OPTIONS...] [FILE]

For all available options please refer to the [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable) documentation. Particularly interesting are:

* -n / --dryrun : Print required steps but do not execute, useful to check before e.g. cluster submissions
* -j / --cores / --jobs : In local mode: Number of provided cores; In cluster mode: number of jobs submitted at the same time
* -k / --keep-going : Continue execution of independent jobs, in case of errors
