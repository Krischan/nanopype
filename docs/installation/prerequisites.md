# Installation

*Important*: If you encounter any trouble within the installation, open an issue on [github](https://github.com/giesselmann/nanopype/issues) to make others aware of the problem or write an E-Mail to ```giesselmann[at]molgen.mpg.de```. There is nothing more annoying than software that does not work.

* Pipeline can be installed on all OS (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
* Explain which installation details would be possible for respective OS
* Explain differences between src, docker, singularity and their advantages/disadvantages/use cases
* Link to the corresponding sites
* Outline the next steps for installation! Make sure people understand that they need to do the configuration step
* Maybe at the end of each section (docker, src, singularity) put link to configuration
